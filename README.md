Translated in english

Plugins for SquadJS that allow you to set various timers with reminders

# timer.js

A plugin that counts down a specified time and reminds you of the timer with a message you enter. Reminds with warms

For example, !timer mbt 30 - the plugin will remind you about the MBT spawn in 30 minutes.

# rally-timer.js

A plugin that will remind you about a new wave in the rally 20 seconds before it starts (so you have time to press give up).

You need to enter the time that your rally is currently showing, for example, if there are 43 seconds until the wave, you need to enter `!rally 43`.

The rest of the details are in the script, it's simple, and the script installation is standard.
